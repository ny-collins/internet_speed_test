## [1.05.0] - 2025-10-15

### ðŸš€ Major Release: Production Observability & Upload Optimization

This release focuses on production-grade backend improvements and fixing critical upload speed measurement issues.

### Added

**Backend Observability Stack:**
- Structured logging with Pino (JSON in production, pretty-printed in development)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) tracking:
  - Request rates and durations by method/path/status
  - Inflight request count
  - Download/upload bytes transferred
  - Circuit breaker status
- Circuit breaker protection (503 when inflight requests > 100)
- Request performance tracking with X-Process-Time header
- Comprehensive error logging with context

**Frontend Diagnostics:**
- Enhanced error logging with detailed context
- Smart streaming support detection with feature testing
- Console logging for debugging upload issues
- Upload generation time tracking

### Changed

**Upload Speed Measurement (BREAKING FIX):**
- Switched from ReadableStream to XHR with `upload.onprogress` for accurate network tracking
- Eliminated slow crypto generation by using reusable 64KB chunk approach
- Fixed crypto.getRandomValues 65KB limit (was trying to generate 256KB chunks)
- Upload generation time reduced from 20+ seconds to <1 second
- Memory usage reduced by 99.4% (40MB+ â†’ 64KB per thread)
- Upload speeds now realistic and comparable to download speeds

**Backend Body Parsing:**
- Skip JSON body parsing for `/api/upload` endpoint to enable true streaming
- Prevents Express from buffering entire upload in memory
- Allows req.on('data') streaming to work correctly

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive README update with new features
- Added all environment variables for backend configuration
- Updated API endpoints documentation with metrics endpoint
- Added v1.05.0 changelog with detailed improvements
- Updated technical features section with backend observability details

### Fixed

- Upload speed showing unrealistic values (55 Mbps vs 5.77 Mbps download)
- Crypto.getRandomValues errors exceeding 65536 byte limit
- REUSABLE_UPLOAD_CHUNK using 256KB instead of 64KB
- Backend body parsing interfering with streaming uploads
- Missing progress tracking for actual network transmission
- Slow upload test due to synchronous data generation

### Performance

- **Upload generation time:** 20+ seconds â†’ <1 second
- **Memory per thread:** 40MB+ â†’ 64KB (99.4% reduction)
- **Upload accuracy:** Now measures network speed, not memory allocation speed
- **Backend efficiency:** Stream processing without memory buffering

### Testing

- All 14 backend tests passing
- Production deployment verified on Railway
- Upload/download speeds showing realistic, comparable values
- AbortController cleanup preventing memory leaks
- Race condition guards preventing double-resolve/reject
