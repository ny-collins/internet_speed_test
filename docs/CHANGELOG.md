## [1.60.1] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed

**Promise Handler Safety:**
- Added `finished` guard to upload thread promise handlers
- Prevents double-resolve when abort fires during onload/onerror
- Pattern: `if (finished) return; finished = true;` before each resolve()
- Ensures promise resolves exactly once in all race conditions
- No functional change to behavior, improves resilience

## [1.60.0] - 2025-10-16

### ðŸš€ Major Release: Fixed-Duration Testing & Complete Application Refinement

This major release represents a fundamental architectural shift to fixed-duration testing, eliminating the UI "freeze" issue and providing fast, accurate, and consistent test results. It also includes all critical bug fixes, quality improvements, and code cleanup developed during the refinement process.

### Changed

**Test Methodology - Fixed Duration:**
- **Download test**: Exactly 10 seconds (previously ~60 seconds)
- **Upload test**: Exactly 10 seconds (previously ~60 seconds)
- **Total test time**: ~25 seconds (vs. ~120 seconds before)
- Tests stop at max duration and measure bytes transferred during that period
- Provides consistent, predictable test duration every time
- CONFIG defaults updated to 10 seconds for both download and upload

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- Eliminated "freeze" appearance during upload/download
- Smooth gauge updates throughout entire test
- No value flashing between measurements
- Settings panel default updated to 10 seconds
- Beautiful gradient update banner with slide-down animation
- "Update Now" and "Later" buttons for user control

### Fixed

**Critical Measurement Issues:**
- Fixed upload speed calculations (transmissionEndTime vs. response time)
- Fixed download speed calculations (actual completion time)
- Removed race conditions in monitor loop
- Fixed duplicate gauge updates causing value conflicts
- Server location banner now shows correct location (was "Unknown")
- Upload speed drop issue (prevents 7 Mbps â†’ 1.3 Mbps drop)
- Real-time display bug - Speed gauge now updates every 100ms during test

**Critical PWA Bugs:**
- PWA update mechanism - Moved `newWorker` and `updateAvailable` to global STATE.pwa object
  - Update Now button now correctly sends SKIP_WAITING message
  - Fixes broken PWA update functionality
- Offline caching - Updated ASSETS_TO_CACHE with versioned file names
  - Fixes silent pre-caching failure and broken offline mode

### Improved

**Stability Detection:**
- Analyze longer window (up to 10 samples instead of 5)
- More reliable detection, less sensitive to single bad intervals
- Enhanced logging shows analysis window size

**Service Worker:**
- Periodic update checks every 60 seconds
- Automatic page reload after update activation
- Better user experience with controlled updates

### Added

**Version Management Automation:**
- Created `build-version.js` script for automatic version synchronization
- Reads version from `package.json` (single source of truth)
- Updates `sw.js` (CACHE_NAME + versioned assets)
- Updates `index.html` and `learn.html` (CSS + JS version queries)
- Railway automatically runs script during build phase
- Eliminates manual sync errors and forgotten updates

**Deployment Architecture:**
- Added `railway.json` for proper build/deploy separation
- Build phase: `npm run build` (version sync)
- Start phase: `npm start` (server only)
- Follows platform best practices

**npm Configuration:**
- Added `.npmrc` files to frontend and backend
- Suppresses npm warnings in deployment logs
- Cleaner Railway deployment output

### Removed

**Code Cleanup (~273 lines total):**
- Thread completion tracking complexity (~88 lines)
- Post-loop gauge updates (monitor loop is now sole source of truth)
- "Finishing phase" logic (no longer needed with fixed duration)
- Deleted `uploadWithStreaming()` - deprecated due to slow crypto generation (~95 lines)
- Deleted `uploadWithFallback()` - deprecated for better cross-browser support (~75 lines)
- Deleted `sendChunkXHR()` - helper only used by fallback (~15 lines)
- Removed unused `result-schema.json` documentation file
- Removed 5 obsolete documentation files

**Package.json Cleanup:**
- Separated build and start scripts
- Start script now only runs server (clean separation of concerns)
- Build script handles version synchronization

### Documentation

**New Comprehensive Documentation:**
- `docs/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` - Design decisions, discrepancies, and rationale (293 lines)
- `docs/FUNCTIONALITY.md` - Complete system architecture and internal workings (576 lines)
- Updated `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Full version history with detailed release notes (296 lines)

**Documentation Structure:**
- Consolidated from 7 files to 3 focused, comprehensive documents
- Removed obsolete review response and clarification files
- Main README.md updated with badges linking to all documentation

### Technical Details

**Why Fixed Duration?**
Speed is measured by observing data transfer over a specific time period. By controlling the measurement window (10 seconds), we get:
- More consistent results across different connection speeds
- Faster tests without waiting for full file transfers
- Simpler, more maintainable code
- Accurate representation of current network speed

**Philosophy:**
> "Speed is measured by taking a small chunk of time and seeing how many packets are transferred."

This release embodies this principle, moving from "test-to-completion" to "fixed-duration" testing.

See `docs/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` for detailed technical rationale and `docs/FUNCTIONALITY.md` for complete system architecture.

### Performance

- Total test time reduced by 80% (~120s â†’ ~25s)
- Reduced `main.js` file size by ~2.5KB (gzipped) due to code cleanup
- Faster initial page load
- More efficient Railway deployments
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## [1.05.0] - 2025-10-15

### ðŸš€ Major Release: Production Observability & Upload Optimization

This release focuses on production-grade backend improvements and fixing critical upload speed measurement issues.

### Added

**Backend Observability Stack:**
- Structured logging with Pino (JSON in production, pretty-printed in development)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) tracking:
  - Request rates and durations by method/path/status
  - Inflight request count
  - Download/upload bytes transferred
  - Circuit breaker status
- Circuit breaker protection (503 when inflight requests > 100)
- Request performance tracking with X-Process-Time header
- Comprehensive error logging with context

**Frontend Diagnostics:**
- Enhanced error logging with detailed context
- Smart streaming support detection with feature testing
- Console logging for debugging upload issues
- Upload generation time tracking

### Changed

**Upload Speed Measurement (BREAKING FIX):**
- Switched from ReadableStream to XHR with `upload.onprogress` for accurate network tracking
- Eliminated slow crypto generation by using reusable 64KB chunk approach
- Fixed crypto.getRandomValues 65KB limit (was trying to generate 256KB chunks)
- Upload generation time reduced from 20+ seconds to <1 second
- Memory usage reduced by 99.4% (40MB+ â†’ 64KB per thread)
- Upload speeds now realistic and comparable to download speeds

**Backend Body Parsing:**
- Skip JSON body parsing for `/api/upload` endpoint to enable true streaming
- Prevents Express from buffering entire upload in memory
- Allows req.on('data') streaming to work correctly

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive README update with new features
- Added all environment variables for backend configuration
- Updated API endpoints documentation with metrics endpoint
- Added v1.05.0 changelog with detailed improvements
- Updated technical features section with backend observability details

### Fixed

- Upload speed showing unrealistic values (55 Mbps vs 5.77 Mbps download)
- Crypto.getRandomValues errors exceeding 65536 byte limit
- REUSABLE_UPLOAD_CHUNK using 256KB instead of 64KB
- Backend body parsing interfering with streaming uploads
- Missing progress tracking for actual network transmission
- Slow upload test due to synchronous data generation

### Performance

- **Upload generation time:** 20+ seconds â†’ <1 second
- **Memory per thread:** 40MB+ â†’ 64KB (99.4% reduction)
- **Upload accuracy:** Now measures network speed, not memory allocation speed
- **Backend efficiency:** Stream processing without memory buffering

### Testing

- All 14 backend tests passing
- Production deployment verified on Railway
- Upload/download speeds showing realistic, comparable values
- AbortController cleanup preventing memory leaks
- Race condition guards preventing double-resolve/reject
