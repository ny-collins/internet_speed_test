## [1.05.1] - 2025-10-15

### ðŸ”§ Maintenance Release: Critical Bug Fixes & Code Quality

This release addresses critical PWA bugs discovered through code review and improves deployment architecture.

### Fixed

**Critical PWA Bugs:**
- PWA update mechanism - Moved `newWorker` and `updateAvailable` to global STATE.pwa object
  - Update Now button now correctly sends SKIP_WAITING message
  - Fixes broken PWA update functionality
- Offline caching - Updated ASSETS_TO_CACHE with versioned file names
  - Changed `/main.js` to `/main.js?v=1.05.0`
  - Changed `/main.css` to `/main.css?v=1.05.0`
  - Fixes silent pre-caching failure and broken offline mode
- Upload speed drop issue - Enhanced XHR upload progress tracking
  - Added `xhr.upload.onloadend` to mark transmission complete
  - Skip zero-progress intervals in speed sample collection
  - Prevents screen freeze and speed drop from 7 Mbps to 1.3 Mbps
- Real-time display bug - Speed gauge now updates every 100ms during test
  - Shows instantaneous speed early, rolling average once stable
  - Fixes em dash (â€”) appearing until test completes

### Improved

**Stability Detection:**
- Analyze longer window (up to 10 samples instead of 5)
- More reliable detection, less sensitive to single bad intervals
- Enhanced logging shows analysis window size

**Service Worker Update UX:**
- Beautiful gradient update banner with slide-down animation
- "Update Now" and "Later" buttons for user control
- Periodic update checks every 60 seconds
- Automatic page reload after update activation

### Added

**Version Management Automation:**
- Created `build-version.js` script for automatic version synchronization
- Reads version from `package.json` (single source of truth)
- Updates `sw.js` (CACHE_NAME + versioned assets)
- Updates `index.html` and `learn.html` (CSS + JS version queries)
- Railway automatically runs script during build phase
- Eliminates manual sync errors and forgotten updates

**Deployment Architecture:**
- Added `railway.json` for proper build/deploy separation
- Build phase: `npm run build` (version sync)
- Start phase: `npm start` (server only)
- Follows platform best practices

**npm Configuration:**
- Added `.npmrc` files to frontend and backend
- Suppresses npm warnings in deployment logs
- Cleaner Railway deployment output

### Removed

**Code Cleanup (~185 lines):**
- Deleted `uploadWithStreaming()` - deprecated due to slow crypto generation
- Deleted `uploadWithFallback()` - deprecated for better cross-browser support
- Deleted `sendChunkXHR()` - helper only used by fallback
- Removed unused `result-schema.json` documentation file

**Package.json Cleanup:**
- Separated build and start scripts
- Start script now only runs server (clean separation of concerns)
- Build script handles version synchronization

### Documentation

- `docs/CODE_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md` - Detailed fixes for critical bugs
- `docs/CODE_REVIEW_CLARIFICATION.md` - Project structure clarifications
- `docs/BUILD_SCRIPT.md` - Version management automation guide
- Updated workflow documentation for new architecture

### Performance

- Reduced `main.js` file size by ~1.8KB (gzipped) due to code cleanup
- Faster initial page load
- More efficient Railway deployments

## [1.05.0] - 2025-10-15

### ðŸš€ Major Release: Production Observability & Upload Optimization

This release focuses on production-grade backend improvements and fixing critical upload speed measurement issues.

### Added

**Backend Observability Stack:**
- Structured logging with Pino (JSON in production, pretty-printed in development)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) tracking:
  - Request rates and durations by method/path/status
  - Inflight request count
  - Download/upload bytes transferred
  - Circuit breaker status
- Circuit breaker protection (503 when inflight requests > 100)
- Request performance tracking with X-Process-Time header
- Comprehensive error logging with context

**Frontend Diagnostics:**
- Enhanced error logging with detailed context
- Smart streaming support detection with feature testing
- Console logging for debugging upload issues
- Upload generation time tracking

### Changed

**Upload Speed Measurement (BREAKING FIX):**
- Switched from ReadableStream to XHR with `upload.onprogress` for accurate network tracking
- Eliminated slow crypto generation by using reusable 64KB chunk approach
- Fixed crypto.getRandomValues 65KB limit (was trying to generate 256KB chunks)
- Upload generation time reduced from 20+ seconds to <1 second
- Memory usage reduced by 99.4% (40MB+ â†’ 64KB per thread)
- Upload speeds now realistic and comparable to download speeds

**Backend Body Parsing:**
- Skip JSON body parsing for `/api/upload` endpoint to enable true streaming
- Prevents Express from buffering entire upload in memory
- Allows req.on('data') streaming to work correctly

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive README update with new features
- Added all environment variables for backend configuration
- Updated API endpoints documentation with metrics endpoint
- Added v1.05.0 changelog with detailed improvements
- Updated technical features section with backend observability details

### Fixed

- Upload speed showing unrealistic values (55 Mbps vs 5.77 Mbps download)
- Crypto.getRandomValues errors exceeding 65536 byte limit
- REUSABLE_UPLOAD_CHUNK using 256KB instead of 64KB
- Backend body parsing interfering with streaming uploads
- Missing progress tracking for actual network transmission
- Slow upload test due to synchronous data generation

### Performance

- **Upload generation time:** 20+ seconds â†’ <1 second
- **Memory per thread:** 40MB+ â†’ 64KB (99.4% reduction)
- **Upload accuracy:** Now measures network speed, not memory allocation speed
- **Backend efficiency:** Stream processing without memory buffering

### Testing

- All 14 backend tests passing
- Production deployment verified on Railway
- Upload/download speeds showing realistic, comparable values
- AbortController cleanup preventing memory leaks
- Race condition guards preventing double-resolve/reject
