## 🎯 What Makes SpeedCheck Different?

Most internet speed tests use **nearby servers** to show you optimal speeds - but that's not how you actually use the internet. SpeedCheck measures your **real-world international connectivity** by testing your connection to a server in **Amsterdam, Netherlands**.

### SpeedCheck vs Other Speed Tests

| Feature | SpeedCheck | Traditional Speed Tests |
|---------|------------|------------------------|
| **Server Location** | Amsterdam, Netherlands (Fixed) | Automatically selects nearest server |
| **What It Measures** | Real international performance | Idealized local network speed |
| **Use Case** | Streaming European content, international browsing, video calls abroad | Local network capacity testing |
| **Distance Impact** | Reflects actual routing and latency | Minimizes distance to show best case |
| **Real-World Accuracy** | Shows speeds you'll actually experience for global content | Shows theoretical maximum speeds |

### When to Use SpeedCheck

✅ **Use SpeedCheck when:**
- You want to know your actual speed to European servers
- You're troubleshooting international streaming (Netflix, BBC iPlayer, sports streams)
- You need to understand your latency for international video conferencing
- You're curious about undersea cable and intercontinental routing performance

❌ **Use traditional speed tests when:**
- You want to test your ISP's maximum local bandwidth
- You're troubleshooting issues with your local network equipment
- You need to verify you're getting the speeds promised by your ISP contract

---

## 🌍 Why Europe?

Our server is hosted in **Amsterdam, Netherlands** - a major internet hub with excellent global connectivity. Testing to a fixed European location provides:

- **Consistent baseline** for comparing results over time
- **Real-world international routing** through undersea cables and continental networks
- **Meaningful metrics** for accessing global content hosted in Europe or routed through European CDNs
- **Distance-based performance** that reflects actual usage patterns for international content

**Physical Reality:** Internet signals don't travel instantly. Light moves at 300,000 km/s, but internet data travels slower through fiber optic cables. Distance creates unavoidable latency - SpeedCheck shows you this reality.

---

## 📊 Understanding Your Results

### Download Speed
How fast you can receive data from European servers. Important for streaming video, downloading files, and loading web pages hosted internationally.

### Upload Speed
How fast you can send data to European servers. Critical for video conferencing, uploading files to cloud storage, and online gaming.

### Ping (Latency)
The round-trip time for a signal to reach Amsterdam and return. **Lower is better.** Physics limits this based on distance - expect 150-300ms from Africa, 100-200ms from Middle East, 10-50ms from Europe.

### Jitter
How consistent your connection is. **Lower is better.** High jitter causes stuttering in video calls and unstable streaming. Good connections have jitter under 20ms.

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

This application uses a **split deployment** on Railway with two separate services:

### Service 1: Frontend (Express Static Server)
- **URL:** https://speed-test.up.railway.app/
- **Type:** Express.js static file server with 404 handling
- **Port:** 8080
- **Files:** HTML, CSS, JS, assets
- **Purpose:** User interface and client-side logic
- **Features:** Custom 404 error page, clean URL routing

### Service 2: Backend (API)
- **URL:** https://speed-test-backend.up.railway.app/
- **Type:** Node.js Express server
- **Port:** 3000
- **Location:** Amsterdam, Netherlands (fixed)
- **Purpose:** Speed test API endpoints

Both services are deployed from the same repository with automatic deployments on push to `main` branch.

---

### Railway Configuration

Create two services in your Railway project:

**Frontend Service:**
```bash
# Build Command:
cd frontend && npm install

# Start Command:
cd frontend && npm start

# Root Directory: /
# Watch Paths: frontend/**
```

**Backend Service:**
```bash
# Build Command:
cd backend && npm install

# Start Command:
cd backend && npm start

# Root Directory: /
# Watch Paths: backend/**
```

### Environment Variables (Backend)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | Server port | 3000 |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | development |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (info, debug, warn, error) | info |
| `SERVER_LOCATION` | Server region label | Amsterdam, Netherlands |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Allowed CORS origins | * |
| `MAX_DOWNLOAD_SIZE_MB` | Maximum download test size | 50 |

---

## 💻 Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ny-collins/internet_speed_test.git
cd internet_speed_test

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Running Locally

**Backend (Terminal 1):**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev  # Starts the API server on http://localhost:3000
```

**Frontend (Terminal 2):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start  # Starts the frontend development server on http://localhost:8080
# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

**Important:** The frontend is designed to connect to the backend API. **You must have both servers running** to perform a speed test. The frontend makes API calls to the backend for download/upload tests and ping measurements.

### ⚠️ Important Note on Local Testing

**Local speed tests will show unrealistic results!** If you test against `localhost`, you'll see speeds of 1000+ Mbps because:

- ❌ **No network distance** - Data doesn't leave your computer
- ❌ **No routing overhead** - Bypasses all internet infrastructure  
- ❌ **No ISP involvement** - No real internet connection
- ❌ **Perfect conditions** - Not representative of actual performance

**For accurate measurements, always test against the [live deployment](https://speed-test.up.railway.app/).** The value of this tool is measuring real international connectivity.

### Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** to frontend or backend code
2. **Test locally** for UI/UX and functionality
3. **Test speed measurements** against live deployment
4. **Commit and push** to trigger automatic Railway deployment

## 📖 What This Project Teaches

This project demonstrates real-world internet concepts:

1. **Internet Geography** - Distance matters; signals can't travel faster than physics allows
2. **Network Routing** - Connection quality depends on multiple hops, undersea cables, and ISP routing
3. **CDN Reality** - Content hosted far away will always be slower than local content
4. **Real-world Performance** - Benchmarks with nearby servers don't reflect actual usage
5. **Latency vs Bandwidth** - High bandwidth doesn't help if latency is high (critical for gaming/calls)
6. **Network Congestion** - Time of day and routing affects international speeds
7. **Jitter & Stability** - Consistent connections matter more than peak speeds for real-time apps

---
